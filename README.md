# GRTMOD
GRTMOD is a program for modeling garnet growth and resorption stages in metamorphic rocks. It can be used for thermobarometry based on reactive bulk compositions. This version of GRTMOD requires any version of Theriak-Domino to run Gibbs energy minimizations.

## What is new and important to know?   (2.0-beta.1) 
- In the project file GRTMODin.txt, you need to add the path to the Theriak directory after the keyword THER (mandatory)
- Duplicate this setup file to work on a new project; note that the new entry "* THER:  /.../Theriak/" must be added to project files compatible with previous versions of GRTMOD.


## Installation
- Download the installer [here](https://github.com/lanari/GRTMOD/releases)
- Run the installer and follow the instructions to setup GRTMOD.

## How to use GRTMOD 2
- Prepapre a folder containing the file GRTMODin.txt and a database file
- Check that the path to the Theriak-Domino directory is properly set after the keyword THER (see above)
- Run GRTMOD.app (macOS) or GRTMOD.exe (WINDOWS)
- Press the button "Set Directory" and pick up a folder containing the file GRTMODin.txt 
- The program checks for the files in the directory. Repeat the previous step until all files are recognised and the button "Run GRTMOD" becomes available
- Press the button "Run GRTMOD"
- Open the file last_GRTMOD.txt to vizualise the progress of the calculation.

## Tutorial

### Getting started
1. Download the tutorial material [here](#)
2. Unzip the files GRTMODin.txt and JUN92.bs. Note that the folder containing these files will be used as working directory and result files will be generated by GRTMOD will be stored there
3. Copy the file Theriak.ini from the Theriak-Domino program folder to the working directory (required for Windows and for some macOS configurations)
4. Run GRTMOD.app (macOS) or GRTMOD.exe (WINDOWS)
5. Press the button "Set Directory" and pick up the right folder

### Stage 1
1. Open GRTMODin.txt using a text editor and maake sure that stage 2 is commented (the line not starting by ">")
    ->> Stage 2
2. Save the file GRTMODin.txt
3. In the GRTMOD window, press the button "Run GRTMOD"

Note: You can open the file last_GRTMOD.txt with a text editor updating the content live to vizualise the progress of the calculation

4. Once the calculations for stage 1 are accomplished, a dialog window appears listing all the solutions for this stage: select the solution and press "Ok"; In this example, a single solution was found for stage 1 at T = 752°C and P = 8235 bar
5. Details results are saved in the file last_GRTMOD.txt
6. A restart file RESTART_Stage(1).mat has been generated
7. Two figures are displayed: a P-T diagram shwoing the result and uncertainty; a mode diagram showing the volume fraction of garnet modeled at each stage

### Notes on the optimization procedure of GRTMOD
The procedure of each stage is divided into three phases: optimization1, optimization2 and auto-refinement. During optimization1, successive minimizations are carried out from different starting P-T guesses in order to determine the global minimum within the P-T window. For stages i > 1, optimization2 refines the garnet fractions to be fractionated, as well as P-T. The starting guess for optimization2 is the best P-T couple obtained during optimization1. A go fast mode is available to run directly optimization2 from user’s favorite P-T initial guess. Finally, the auto-refinement stage checks the local variability of the objective function in order to provide a relative uncertainty on the P-T estimate.

In this example (stage 1) the solution of the RUN 1/4 is selected as the best solution.

### Stage 2
